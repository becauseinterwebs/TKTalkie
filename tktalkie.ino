 * 
 * This simple sketch is meant to use a Teensy 3.2 with a 
 * Teensy Audio Shield and reads sounds from an SD card and plays 
 * them after the user stops talking to simulate comm noise 
 * such as clicks and static.  It can be easily adapted to be 
 * used with other controllers and audio shields.
 * 
 * This sketch incorporates some of the sample code provided with 
 * Teensy and Arduino.
 * 
 * You are free to use this code in your own projects, provided 
 * they are non-commercial in use.
 * 
 * The audio components and connections were made using the GUI tool 
 * available at http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/gui.  If you want to modify 
 * the signal path, add more effects, etc., you can copy and paste the 
 * code marked by 'GUITool' into the online editor at the above URL.
 * 
 * A lot of this code was taken from the example code that comes with 
 * Teensy/Arduino and modified.
